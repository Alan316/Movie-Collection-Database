# MovieLogue
DVD and digital film collection cataloging app built in Node.JS using MongoDB, Express, and Bootstrap



I hope to achieve the following functionality within this website. : 
⋅⋅
1. Give users the ability to register witht he site and create a new account. 

2. Users will be able to create a personal databse of films they own. The database shoulds contain the following information:
  ⋅⋅
  a. Title of film
  b. Year produced
  c. Format of film that is wned (DVD/Blu Ray/HD DVD/VHS/Beta Max/Digital) - Site should allow for multiple selections
  d. Main Actors featured in the film
  e. Director of Film
  f. Date purchased if applicable
  g. Notes section for additional information about the film
  h. Ratings system so that the user can provide his own feedback for the film. 
  i. Review section allowing the user to give his own synopsis of the film that can be seen and shared by other users
  j. The ability to add a screenshot to the databse if posible of the DVD cover or movie poster. 
⋅⋅
3. The app will have a feature allowing it to connect to either OMDB or IMDB to view official information regarding the film. (Note that the IMDB Node.JS plug is not a scraper while the OMDB one is. I have not decided yet which one I will use.) 

4. Utimately users will be able to customize their profile information on the website and add a small avatar image


I'm using this project to learn MongoDB and Node.JS while also organizing my movie collection
